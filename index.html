                <h2>Software Development Intern</h2>
                <p>I am currently pursuing a BSc Computer Science in UCD, looking to develop a career within the IT industry, primarily focusing on full stack web development.
                As a driven worker who is motivated by success, I am very ambitious and set high goals in order to achieve the optimum results in all areas of work. Presently, I am interning at SoftPotential within the Digital Hub, primarily focusing on web design and development, as well as an overall professional development. This has allowed me to gain valuable experience within the IT industry, which will provide an excellent foundation moving forward. My time and experience within the retail industry has allowed great development of my business and customer service skills, as well as my ability to work within a team dynamic. These skills, coupled with my Computer Science background, offer any organisation an experienced, multi-disciplined individual who will provide a unique and innovative approach to creatively solving problems through comprehensible and feasible solutions.</p>
